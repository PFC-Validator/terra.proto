# RUST bindings
this is still a work in progress, and manual.

1. update the submodules to the desired version.
2. uncomment the area in the build.rs one at a time.
   1. tendermint first. 
      1. you will need to fix up the module.rs files to include more things than autogenerated. (look at the git history)
      2. some things require imports in the files themselves.
   2. cosmos next.. same thing as tendermint.
   3. then finally the terra stuff

yes it's manual, but it's not that bad... eventually it will be automated/fixed... but it's kinda working, and there are bigger hills to climb.
